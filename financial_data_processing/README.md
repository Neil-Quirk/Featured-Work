# Financial Data Pre-Processing

### The Problem

The initial problem was the time and effort it took to create the report manually. 
The sheets used were large and took several minutes to open in excel and just as long to make any changes. 
The whole process took a single administrator, on average, 45 minutes to complete baring any unexpected 
errors arising from employee number formatting. Given th extreme time limit required for this report
the administrator was under significant pressure.

### The Solution.

Write a python script that takes care of the pre-processing of 
the data leaving the administrator to simply format the report to the desired look.

### Results

The report now takes a single administrator 5-10 minutes to complete
down from 45 minutes

There is less room for error as there is no manual processing
